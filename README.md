Learning C# for 2 Months
60-Day C# Learning Plan

This is a structured plan for learning C# over 60 days, with 1-hour daily sessions. The plan progresses from setting up the development environment to intermediate topics, incorporating theory, exercises, and small projects. Adjust the pace or revisit topics as needed based on your progress.





<b>Day 1:</b> Set up the C# development environment - install Visual Studio Community (or VS Code with C# extension), .NET SDK, and create a "Hello World" console app to verify setup.



<b>Day 2:</b> Learn C# basics - variables, data types (int, string, bool), and console output (Console.WriteLine).



<b>Day 3:</b> Explore operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical) and basic input handling (Console.ReadLine).



<b>Day 4:</b> Study control structures - if, else, and switch statements for decision-making.



<b>Day 5:</b> Understand loops - for, while, and do-while loops for iteration.



<b>Day 6:</b> Practice loops with simple exercises (e.g., print patterns or calculate sums).



<b>Day 7:</b> Work with arrays - declaration, initialization, and accessing elements.



<b>Day 8:</b> Practice array manipulation - looping through arrays and basic array methods.



<b>Day 9:</b> Introduction to methods - defining and calling methods with parameters.



<b>Day 10:</b> Explore method return types and void methods.



<b>Day 11:</b> Practice method overloading and optional parameters.



Day 12: Learn about strings - concatenation, interpolation, and common string methods.



Day 13: Practice string manipulation - trimming, splitting, and formatting.



Day 14: Introduction to lists - List creation, adding, and removing elements.



Day 15: Work with List methods - sorting, searching, and iterating.



Day 16: Build a console app using arrays and lists (e.g., a simple to-do list).



Day 17: Learn about scope and access modifiers (public, private, protected).



Day 18: Introduction to object-oriented programming (OOP) - classes and objects.



Day 19: Create a simple class with properties and methods.



Day 20: Learn about constructors and object initialization.



Day 21: Practice inheritance - creating base and derived classes.



Day 22: Explore polymorphism - method overriding and virtual methods.



Day 23: Learn about interfaces - defining and implementing interfaces.



Day 24: Build a console app using classes and interfaces (e.g., a basic inventory system).



Day 25: Learn about exception handling - try, catch, and finally blocks.



Day 26: Practice custom exception creation and throwing exceptions.



Day 27: Introduction to file I/O - reading and writing text files.



Day 28: Practice file I/O with a console app (e.g., saving/loading a list).



Day 29: Explore the System.IO namespace - directories and file management.



Day 30: Learn about enums and their use cases.



Day 31: Build a console app using enums (e.g., a task status tracker).



Day 32: Introduction to LINQ - basic queries with Where and Select.



Day 33: Practice LINQ - ordering, grouping, and joining data.



Day 34: Explore anonymous types and lambda expressions in LINQ.



Day 35: Work with collections - HashSet, Dictionary, and Queue.



Day 36: Practice Dictionary - key-value pair operations and iteration.



Day 37: Build a console app using LINQ and Dictionary (e.g., a word frequency counter).



Day 38: Learn about nullable types and null-coalescing operators.



Day 39: Explore DateTime and TimeSpan for date/time operations.



Day 40: Build a console app for scheduling tasks using DateTime.



Day 41: Introduction to async/await - asynchronous programming basics.



Day 42: Practice async methods with Task and Task.



Day 43: Build an async console app (e.g., simulating data fetching).



Day 44: Learn about unit testing - setting up a test project with MSTest or NUnit.



Day 45: Write unit tests for a simple class.



Day 46: Practice dependency injection - basics and setup.



Day 47: Build a console app with dependency injection.



Day 48: Introduction to ASP.NET Core - setting up a basic web app.



Day 49: Learn about MVC architecture in ASP.NET Core.



Day 50: Build a simple ASP.NET Core MVC web app (e.g., a to-do list).



Day 51: Explore Razor pages in ASP.NET Core.



Day 52: Practice data binding in Razor pages.



Day 53: Build a Razor page app with CRUD operations.



Day 54: Learn about Entity Framework Core - basics and setup.



Day 55: Practice EF Core - creating and querying a database.



Day 56: Explore EF Core relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many).



Day 57: Build a console app with EF Core for data management.



Day 58: Learn about REST APIs - basics and structure.



Day 59: Build a simple REST API with ASP.NET Core.



Day 60: Build a final project - a full-stack app with ASP.NET Core, EF Core, and a REST API (e.g., a task management app).

Notes





For Day 1, download Visual Studio Community or VS Code from the official Microsoft website, and install the .NET SDK. Follow tutorials on Microsoft Learn for setup guidance.



Use resources like Microsoft Learn, Codecademy, or books like "C# in Depth" by Jon Skeet.



Practice coding daily on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or Exercism.



Join C# communities (e.g., Reddit, Stack Overflow) for support and questions.



Revisit challenging topics every 10-15 days to reinforce learning.



Adjust the schedule based on your pace and interests, especially for project days.
