Learning C# for 2 Months
60-Day C# Learning Plan

This is a structured plan for learning C# over 60 days, with 1-hour daily sessions. The plan progresses from beginner to intermediate topics, incorporating theory, exercises, and small projects. Adjust the pace or revisit topics as needed based on your progress.





Day 1: Learn C# basics - variables, data types (int, string, bool), and console output (Console.WriteLine).



Day 2: Explore operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical) and basic input handling (Console.ReadLine).



Day 3: Study control structures - if, else, and switch statements for decision-making.



Day 4: Understand loops - for, while, and do-while loops for iteration.



Day 5: Practice loops with simple exercises (e.g., print patterns or calculate sums).



Day 6: Work with arrays - declaration, initialization, and accessing elements.



Day 7: Practice array manipulation - looping through arrays and basic array methods.



Day 8: Introduction to methods - defining and calling methods with parameters.



Day 9: Explore method return types and void methods.



Day 10: Practice method overloading and optional parameters.



Day 11: Learn about strings - concatenation, interpolation, and common string methods.



Day 12: Practice string manipulation - trimming, splitting, and formatting.



Day 13: Introduction to lists - List creation, adding, and removing elements.



Day 14: Work with List methods - sorting, searching, and iterating.



Day 15: Build a console app using arrays and lists (e.g., a simple to-do list).



Day 16: Learn about scope and access modifiers (public, private, protected).



Day 17: Introduction to object-oriented programming (OOP) - classes and objects.



Day 18: Create a simple class with properties and methods.



Day 19: Learn about constructors and object initialization.



Day 20: Practice inheritance - creating base and derived classes.



Day 21: Explore polymorphism - method overriding and virtual methods.



Day 22: Learn about interfaces - defining and implementing interfaces.



Day 23: Build a console app using classes and interfaces (e.g., a basic inventory system).



Day 24: Learn about exception handling - try, catch, and finally blocks.



Day 25: Practice custom exception creation and throwing exceptions.



Day 26: Introduction to file I/O - reading and writing text files.



Day 27: Practice file I/O with a console app (e.g., saving/loading a list).



Day 28: Explore the System.IO namespace - directories and file management.



Day 29: Learn about enums and their use cases.



Day 30: Build a console app using enums (e.g., a task status tracker).



Day 31: Introduction to LINQ - basic queries with Where and Select.



Day 32: Practice LINQ - ordering, grouping, and joining data.



Day 33: Explore anonymous types and lambda expressions in LINQ.



Day 34: Work with collections - HashSet, Dictionary, and Queue.



Day 35: Practice Dictionary - key-value pair operations and iteration.



Day 36: Build a console app using LINQ and Dictionary (e.g., a word frequency counter).



Day 37: Learn about nullable types and null-coalescing operators.



Day 38: Explore DateTime and TimeSpan for date/time operations.



Day 39: Build a console app for scheduling tasks using DateTime.



Day 40: Introduction to async/await - asynchronous programming basics.



Day 41: Practice async methods with Task and Task.



Day 42: Build an async console app (e.g., simulating data fetching).



Day 43: Learn about unit testing - setting up a test project with MSTest or NUnit.



Day 44: Write unit tests for a simple class.



Day 45: Practice dependency injection - basics and setup.



Day 46: Build a console app with dependency injection.



Day 47: Introduction to ASP.NET Core - setting up a basic web app.



Day 48: Learn about MVC architecture in ASP.NET Core.



Day 49: Build a simple ASP.NET Core MVC web app (e.g., a to-do list).



Day 50: Explore Razor pages in ASP.NET Core.



Day 51: Practice data binding in Razor pages.



Day 52: Build a Razor page app with CRUD operations.



Day 53: Learn about Entity Framework Core - basics and setup.



Day 54: Practice EF Core - creating and querying a database.



Day 55: Explore EF Core relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many).



Day 56: Build a console app with EF Core for data management.



Day 57: Learn about REST APIs - basics and structure.



Day 58: Build a simple REST API with ASP.NET Core.



Day 59: Practice API authentication with JWT tokens.



Day 60: Build a final project - a full-stack app with ASP.NET Core, EF Core, and a REST API (e.g., a task management app).

Notes





Use resources like Microsoft Learn, Codecademy, or books like "C# in Depth" by Jon Skeet.



Practice coding daily on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or Exercism.



Join C# communities (e.g., Reddit, Stack Overflow) for support and questions.



Revisit challenging topics every 10-15 days to reinforce learning.



Adjust the schedule based on your pace and interests, especially for project days.
